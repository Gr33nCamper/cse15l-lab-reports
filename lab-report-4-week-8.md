Three code snippets
Add test for each to your own code and the one you reviewed
Determine expected output
Comment if short code change could be made to fix problem

&nbsp;

Your report should include:
A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
For each test above:
Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site
Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test
For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:
Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
